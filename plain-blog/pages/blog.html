    <h1>The Odin Project - Day 10</h1>


    <h2>First Assignment - Working with Text</h2>
    <p>
      I am starting to learn web design through
      <strong>The Odin Project</strong> about a couple of weeks ago on 28 Dec
      2022. Today is 7 Jan 2023, and I'm doing this <strong>First</strong> assignment where we need to
      make a blog article using plain text. Today marks day 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I'm doing pretty well. I'm done with most of the basics: setting
      up git, etc and starting up with HTML now.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little bit of background about me. I'm a <em>Civil Engineer</em> by
      training, and I am a Project Manager working full time in the construction
      industry. I'm learning web-dev to try and develop a web-app for the
      construction industry. You see, I have this vision of creating the next
      uber for the construction industry. This will be the first step towards
      that. We'll see how things work out!
    </p>
    <p>
      I've tried a few things before the Odin Project. I went through the first
      lecture of CS50, and I paid for a JS course in Udemy. I hate watching the
      videos because sometimes I miss something and have to go back to the right
      spot on the video. The Odin Project solves that issue for me by making me
      go look for the issue myself. I also leverage ChatGPT if I encounter any
      issue with my code, to try and debug quickly and understand where I made a
      mistake.
    </p>
    <p>In terms of web-dev experience:
        <ol>
            <li>I have tried learning html in 2007 through W3 schools but man that's rough... </li>
            <li>In 2011, I helped my dad create a website for a business but all I knew was html so it looked terrible compared to all the awesome websites I see on the internet. So that discouraged me significantly. Then my dad hired a freelancer without my knowledge and <strong>paid him</strong> money to take care of the website. Just because I was doing it I guess... The website they did looked much better, because they were able to use WordPress templates. I didn't have a clue how to use WordPress, but they didn't know how to use HTML / CSS, and I was just starting up. They told me I must know a heck of a lot more than them. So... yes, that was also why I stopped learning html in 2011. Because I thought I took the wrong step and didn't know how to get back on the right track. There weren't as much resources back then....</strong></li>
        </ol></p>
